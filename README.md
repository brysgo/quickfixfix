Quick Fix Fix
-------------

A quick plugin I wrote to get some of nerd tree's keybindings in the quickfix window.

Supports:
+------+-----------------------------------+
| key  | description                       |
+------+-----------------------------------+
| o    | opens a file (alias to return)    |
+------+-----------------------------------+
| i    | opens the file in split           |
+------+-----------------------------------+
| s    | opens the file in vertical split  |
+------+-----------------------------------+
| go   | open the file without moving to it|
+------+-----------------------------------+
